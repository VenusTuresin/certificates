# My Certificates

This repository showcases the certificates I have earned during my learning journey in data analysis, SQL, Python, and Programming.  

## Certificates & Learning

**Introduction to SQL (Kaggle)**

Through the Intro to SQL course, I practiced the following key concepts:

1. **Getting Started with SQL and BigQuery** – Setting up and handling large datasets using Google BigQuery.  
2. **SELECT, FROM & WHERE** – Writing basic SQL queries with filtering conditions.  
3. **GROUP BY, HAVING & COUNT** – Aggregating and analyzing data with grouping and conditional filters.  
4. **ORDER BY** – Sorting query results to highlight the most relevant insights.  
5. **AS & WITH** – Using aliases and common table expressions (CTEs) for cleaner, more organized queries.  
6. **Joining Data** – Combining multiple tables to extract meaningful, real-world insights.
